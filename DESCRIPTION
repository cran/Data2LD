Description: Provides methods for using differential equations as modelling  
 objects as described in J. Ramsay G. and Hooker (2017,ISBN 978-1-4939-7188-6) 
 Dynamic Data Analysis, New York: Springer. Data sets and script files for 
 analyzing many of the examples in this book are included. This version 
 corrects bugs and adds two new demos, CruiseControl and monotoneSmoothDemo. 
 This version incorporates a new system for indexing coefficient list objects.
 The step of setting up a set of coefficient list objects has been 
 eliminated and the functions make.Coef() and coefCheck have been dropped.
 'Matlab' versions of the code and sample analyses are available by ftp from 
 the website.  There you find a set of .zip files containing the functions 
 and sample analyses, as well as two .txt files giving instructions for 
 installation and some additional information.
